Subject: [PATCH 12/17] Make fullscreen enabling work as used to with pref
 full-screen-api.content-only. Fixes JB#44129

We don't have chrome from doc shell point of view. This commit
sha1 3116f3bf53df offends fullscreen API to work without chrome
and shall not make root docShell act as chrome. We previously had
"full-screen-api.content-only" pref set to "true".
